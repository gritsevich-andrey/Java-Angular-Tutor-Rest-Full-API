# Spring Two-factor authentication example

This repository contains a source code for the post on [2fa authentication for Spring Webflux APIs](https://www.mednikov.tech/two-factor-authentication-for-spring-webflux-apis/).

In this article I will show how to write a two-factor authentication for reactive API, built with Spring Webflux. This app uses TOTP (one-time codes, generated by app on the user device â€“ like Google Authenticator) as the second security factor, alongside with email and password pairs.
